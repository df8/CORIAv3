<p><b>CORIA</b> is a system designed to analyse networks (or graphs) of any size. In the context of Autonomous Systems (AS) we consider the Internet a network of interconnected
    routers where an AS can be represented by a node and the physical link between any two AS as an edge. This allows us to transfer research problems such as measuring global and
    regional Internet resilience into known and in some cases already solved mathematical problems within the field of graph theory.</p>
<p>The CAIDA import module supports the following file type. You can drag and drop files in any order, as CORIA accepts multiple files with the described format and merges
    all provided information into a single list of AS Locations. </p>

<h3>Autonomous System Locations Dataset</h3>
<div><i>At least one file of this type is required.</i>
    <p>In order to understand technical and economic implications for the Internet stability, CAIDA publishes an association mapping between pairs of AS (AS links) and their
        estimated geographic locations.<sup>[1]</sup> "Understanding the geographic nature of these relationships can facilitate activities such as: realistic
        simulation of AS path prediction; application performance estimation; predicting the likelihood that two ASes will interconnect; and visualizing the geographic distribution
        of networks."<sup>[1]</sup> This import module allows you to import a batch of locations from files provided by CAIDA.</p>
    <p><b>Format definition for AS Location files: </b> <sup>[2]</sup></p>
    <pre>location ID|continent ID|country ID|region ID|city|latitude|longitude|population number</pre>
    Example:
    <pre>Berlin-BE-DE|EU|DE|BE|Berlin|52.5303|13.3333|0</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the above line, we add a new entry for the city <code>Berlin</code> in the region <code>BE</code> (<i>state of Berlin</i>) of <code>DE</code>
        (<i>Germany</i>) located in <code>EU</code> (<i>Europe</i>) and having the GPS coordinates <code>52.5303 N, 13.3333 E</code>.
    </p>
    <p><b>Download:</b> Compatible AS location files can be obtained from data.caida.org:&nbsp;e.g. <code>201603.locations.txt.gz</code> Link: <a

    <p>Please extract the text file from the caida.org-provided .gz archive before uploading.</p>
