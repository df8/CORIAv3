<p>The CAIDA import module supports the following four types of files. You can drag and drop these files in any order. CORIA accepts multiple files for all four types and merges
    all provided information into a single
    dataset. </p>
<h3>1. Autonomous System Links (AS Link) Dataset</h3>
<div><i>At least one file of this type is required.</i>
    <p> The AS Link files are being generated regularly by CAIDA's active network measurement infrastructure called Archipelago (Ark).<sup>[1]</sup> Three teams of network
        monitoring devices generate these datasets.
        An AS-Link file contains four different types of lines. However, we only process text lines beginning either with <code>D</code> or with <code>I</code>. Lines starting with
        an <code>M</code> for monitors, with
        a <code>T</code> for timestamps, and with a <code>#</code> for comments are being ignored. The parameters are separated by <code>TAB</code> characters.
    </p>
    <p><b>Format definition for direct links: </b> <sup>[2]</sup></p>
    <pre>D    from_AS    to_AS   monitor_key1   monitor_key2   ...</pre>
    Example:
    <pre>D     1909       1227        0              3</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the above line, we learn that the monitoring devices #0 and #3 each traced a direct route between <code>from_AS</code> and <code>to_AS</code>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Format definition for indirect links: </b> <sup>[2]</sup></p>
    <pre>I   from_AS   to_AS   gap_length   monitor_key1   monitor_key2   ...</pre>
    Example:
    <pre>I     1909     1227        2            0              3</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the above line, we learn that the monitoring devices #0 and #3 each indirectly traced a route between <code>from_AS</code> and <code>to_AS</code>.
        "An indirect AS link exists if two ASes in an AS path are separated by a gap caused by either an unresponsive hop or an inability to map an IP address to an AS number.
        [...]
        If two different monitors see gaps of differing lengths between the same pair of ASes, then there will be two separate indirect link lines." <sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>

    <p><b>Download:</b> Compatible AS link files can be obtained from data.caida.org - for example for Team 1, Year 2020:&nbsp;
        <a href="http://data.caida.org/datasets/topology/ark/ipv4/as-links/team-1/2020/"
           target="blank">http://data.caida.org/datasets/topology/ark/ipv4/as-links/team-1/2020/</a></p>
    <p><b>Merge feature:</b> If you upload multiple AS link files, all edges will be merged into a single dataset. Two lines are considered duplicates if: it is a direct link with
        the same values
        for <code>from_AS</code> and <code>to_AS</code> or if is an indirect link with the same values for <code>from_AS</code>, <code>to_AS</code> and <code>gap_length</code>.</p>
    <p>Please extract the text file from the caida.org-provided .gz archive before uploading.</p>
</div>

<h3>2. Autonomous Systems to Organizations Mapping (AS-to-Org) Dataset</h3>
<div><i>This file type is optional.</i>
    <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Before importing AS-to-Org mapping files, please make sure that the <code>AS Organization</code> table has been populated with a list of all known
        organizations.</p>
    <p>In their effort to infer which organizations operate which Autonomous System(s), since 2009 CAIDA quarterly scans WHOIS database dumps and extracts the organization listed
        for each AS.<sup>[5][6]</sup> Understanding how various parts of the Internet infrastructure are distributed among the operating organizations allows to unravel "the
        topological and
        economic structure of the
        Internet"<sup>[6]</sup>. An example of a WHOIS entry can be found under [3]. </p>

    <p>An AS-to-Org file contains two types of entry lines: a list of organizations (with organization names and identifiers) and a list of association mappings from Autonomous
        Systems to organizations. The CAIDA import module only parses the association mappings.</p>
    <p><b>Format definition for AS-to-organization mappings: </b> <sup>[4]</sup></p>
    <pre>AS number|date changed|AS name|organization ID|opaque id|entry source (database)</pre>
    Example:
    <pre>11|20190812|HARVARD|HARVAR-ARIN|88e9e1a9f78221c5b97e72d580642205_ARIN|ARIN</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the above line, we learn that according to WHOIS information gathered from the <code>ARIN</code> database the <code>AS00011</code> is operated by
        the <code>HARVAR-ARI</code> organization
        which is the <code>Harvard University</code>, <code>US</code>. </p>
    <p><b>Download:</b> Compatible AS-org2info files can be obtained from data.caida.org:&nbsp;
        <a href="http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-organizations/"
           target="blank">http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-organizations/</a></p>
    <p><b>Merge feature:</b> If you upload multiple AS-to-Org files, the import module will ignore duplicates. Two lines are considered duplicates with the same values for <code>AS
        number</code>, <code>organization ID</code> and <code>date changed</code>. An AS can be assigned to multiple organizations, each assignment being tracked by the change
        date.</p>
    <p>Please extract the text file from the caida.org-provided .gz archive before uploading.</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Autonomous Systems Type Classification (AS-to-Type) Dataset</h3>
<div><i>This file type is optional.</i>
    <p>In order to analyse the business type/field of application for each Autonomous System, the CAIDA project collected a set of self-reported information about each AS from the
        external database <i>PeeringDB</i> and
        labelled a range of AS with the three classes <code>Transit / Access</code>, <code>Content</code> or <code>Enterprise</code>.<sup>[7]</sup> Based on the collected input
        features and output labels, CAIDA built
        a machine learning classifier to assign each AS one of these classes. Importing this classification into CORIA allows researchers to apply an additional filter and thus the
        Internet resilience and connectivity
        risk analysis research can limit its focus on one of these three business sectors. </p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr class="headerRow">
            <th>Source</th>
            <th> description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>CAIDA_class</th>
            <td>Classification was an inference from the machine-learning classifier</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>peerDB_class</th>
            <td>AS classification was obtained directly from the PeeringDB database</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="headerRow">
            <th>Class</th>
            <th> description</th>

            <th>Transit / Access</th>
            <td> ASes which was inferred to be either a transit and/or access provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Content</th>
            <td>ASes which provide content hosting and distribution systems.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Enterprise</th>
            <td>Various organizations, universities and companies at the network edge that are mostly users, rather than providers of Internet access, transit or content.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <i>Table 1: Possible values for column <code>Source</code> and column <code>Class</code> in the AS-to-type CAIDA dataset. Source: [7]</i>
    <p><b>Format definition for AS-to-type mappings: </b> <sup>[4]</sup></p>
    <pre>AS number|Source|Class</pre>
    Examples:
    <pre>2|CAIDA_class|Content<br/>30|CAIDA_class|Enterprise<br/>209|peerDB_class|Transit/Access</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the first line, we learn that according to the machine learning model (marked with <code>CAIDA_class</code>) the <code>AS00002</code> is operated
        with the purpose of <code>content hosting and distribution</code>. </p>
    <p><b>Download:</b> Compatible AS-to-types files can be obtained from data.caida.org:&nbsp;
        <a href="http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-classification/" target="blank">http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-classification/</a></p>
    <p><b>Merge feature:</b> If you upload multiple AS-to-Org files, the import module will ignore duplicates. Two lines are considered duplicates with the same values for all
        three columns. A conflict is detected when
        an AS is being assigned to two <i>different</i> classes. In this case we use the association with the more current date found in the uploaded file name. We consider an
        Autonomous System to always be assigned to a single class.</p>
    <p>Please extract the text file from the caida.org-provided .gz archive before uploading.</p>
</div>

<h3>4. Autonomous Systems Links to Geolocation Mapping (AS-Link-to-Geo) Dataset</h3>
<div><i>This file type is optional.</i>
    <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Before importing AS-Link-to-Geo mapping files, please make sure that the <code>AS Location</code> table has been populated with a list of all known
        geolocations.</p>
    <p>In order to understand technical and economic implications for the Internet stability, CAIDA combines and processes information from four data sources and publishes an
        association mapping between pairs of AS (AS
        links) and their estimated geographic locations.<sup>[8]</sup> "Understanding the geographic nature of these relationships can facilitate activities such as: realistic
        simulation of AS path prediction;
        application performance estimation; predicting the likelihood that two ASes will interconnect; and visualizing the geographic distribution of networks."<sup>[8]</sup></p>
    <p><b>Format definition for AS-Link-to-Geo mappings: </b> <sup>[9]</sup></p>
    <pre>AS0|AS1|loc0,source0.0,source0.1,loc1|loc1,source1.0...</pre>
    Example:
    <pre>24|6939|Huntsville-AL-US,edge|Palo Alto-CA-US,lg</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the above line, we learn that the <code>Edge AS link (edge)</code> method was used to infer a link between <code>AS00024</code> and
        <code>AS06939</code> in <code>Huntsville-AL-US</code>.
        Additionally the <code>Looking Glass Servers (lg)</code> method returned an estimated geographic location of the link between these two networks in <code>Palo
            Alto-CA-US</code>. Thus, in total we have two
        physical
        locations for the link between <code>AS00024</code> and <code>AS06939</code>.
    </p>
    <p><b>Download:</b> Compatible AS-Link-to-Geo files can be obtained from data.caida.org:&nbsp;
