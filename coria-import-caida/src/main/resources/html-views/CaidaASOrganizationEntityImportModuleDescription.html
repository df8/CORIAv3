<p><b>CORIA</b> is a system designed to analyse networks (or graphs) of any size. In the context of Autonomous Systems (AS) we consider the Internet a network of interconnected
    routers where an AS can be represented by a node and the physical link between any two AS as an edge. This allows us to transfer research problems such as measuring global and
    regional Internet resilience into known and in some cases already solved mathematical problems within the field of graph theory.</p>
<p>The CAIDA import module supports the following file type. You can drag and drop files in any order, as CORIA accepts multiple files with the described format and merges
    all provided information into a single list of AS Organizations. </p>

<h3>Autonomous System Organizations Dataset</h3>
<div><i>At least one file of this type is required.</i>
    <p>In their effort to infer which organizations operate which Autonomous System(s), since 2009 CAIDA quarterly scans WHOIS database dumps and extracts the organization listed
        for each AS.<sup>[1][2]</sup> Understanding how various parts of the Internet infrastructure are distributed among the operating organizations allows to unravel "the
        topological and economic structure of the Internet"<sup>[2]</sup>. An example of a WHOIS entry can be found under [3]. </p>

    <p>This import module allows you to import a batch of organizations from files provided by CAIDA.</p>
    <p><b>Format definition for AS Organization files: </b> <sup>[4]</sup></p>
    <pre>organization ID|date of last entry change|organization name|country ID|source database</pre>
    Example:
    <pre>HARVAR-ARIN|20190812|Harvard University|US|ARIN</pre>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> From the above line, we add a new entry for the organization <code>Harvard University</code>, initially found via a WHOIS lookup in the database
        <code>ARIN</code>, located in <code>US</code> and identified by <code>HARVAR-ARIN</code>.
    </p>
    <p><b>Download:</b> Compatible AS organization files can be obtained from data.caida.org:&nbsp;e.g. <code>20200401.as-org2info.txt.gz</code> Link: <a
            href="http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-organizations/" target="blank">http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-organizations/</a>
    </p>
    <p>Please extract the text file from the caida.org-provided .gz archive before uploading.</p>
